## LegacyHotbars+
LegacyHotbars+ is a fork of the Hotbars+ mod for Minecraft that aims to support Legacy Fabric..

### How does it work?
The mod works by hijacking the saved hotbar system Minecraft uses to use a different file to load and save from in place of the traditional `hotbar.nbt`, hot-swapping files for each page.

### Does it work yet?
Not yet. Work is being done to get it up and running, though.
